ActiveDynamic allows to dynamically add properties to your ActiveRecord models and 
work with them as regular properties.
To see this in practice, check out the demo application available at [https://github.com/koss-lebedev/active_dynamic_demo](https://github.com/koss-lebedev/active_dynamic_demo).
I also wrote [an article](https://medium.com/@koss_lebedev/how-to-dynamically-add-attributes-to-your-activerecord-models-e233b17ad695#.k66n002of) explaining how to use active_dynamic.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_dynamic'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_dynamic

## Usage

To make this gem work, first you need to add `has_dynamic_attributes` to the model that needs to have dynamic 
attributes. For example, if you have `Profile` model:
 
```ruby
class Profile < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_dynamic_attributes
  
  # ...
end  
```

After that you need to set a class that will resolve definitions of the dynamic attributes to be created on `Profile` model:

```ruby
# lib/initializers/dynamic_attribute.rb

ActiveDynamic.configure do |config|
  config.provider_class = ProfileAttributeProvider
end

class ProfileAttributeProvider

  # Constructor will receive a class to which dynamic attributes are added
  def initialize(model_class)
    @model_class = model_class    
  end
  
  # This method has to return array of dynamic field definitions.
  # You can get it from the configuration file, DB, etc., depending on your app logic
  def call
    [
      # attribute definition has to specify attribute display name
      ActiveDynamic::AttributeDefinition.new('biography'),
      
      # Optionally you can provide datatype, system name, and default value.
      # If system name is not specified, it will be generated automatically from display name
      ActiveDynamic::AttributeDefinition.new('age', datatype: ActiveDynamic::DataType::Integer, default_value: 18)
    ]
  end
  
end

```

To resolve dynamic attribute definitions for more than one model:

```ruby
class Profile < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_dynamic_attributes
  
  # ...
end  
 
class Document < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_dynamic_attributes
  
  # ...
end  
 
class ProfileAttributeProvider
 
  def initialize(model_class)
    @model_class = model_class    
  end
  
  def call
    if @model_class == Profile
      [
        # attribute definitions for Profile model
      ] 
    elsif @model_class == Document
      [
        # attribute definitions for Document model
      ] 
    else
      []
    end
  end
  
end
```
